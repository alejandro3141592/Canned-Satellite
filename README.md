# Canned-Satellite

This repository contains the work made for the Iberoamerican Contest of Canned Satellite 2023, which consisted in the development of a telemetry system oriented to the instrumentation of variables in a free fall from 400 meters.

The system consisted in a cilynder with a diameter of 10 cm and a height of 22 cm, and had the necesary components to sense the altitude, the presure, the temperature, th satelitte yaw, pitch and roll, among others. In addition, the satellite is designed to be dropped at a height of 400 meters, and then at 250 meters deploy an autogyro system that is in charge of decressing the speed fall of the satellite.

In order to make the satellite work, I developed all the electronic system, in charge of sensig all the neeeded variables, and for decoupling the secondary charge of the system.
