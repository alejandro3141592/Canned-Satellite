In this folder, I present an electronic circuit design in Proteus that corresponds to the primary and secondary charge of the Canned Satellite.

The first circuit is in charge of sensing all the variables required by the contest committee, including the temperature, altitude, pressure, pitch, yaw and roll, and so on.

The second circuit is in charge of decoupling the secondary stage of the satellite and sending messages to the primary stage.
